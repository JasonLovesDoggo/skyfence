# Fetchers Module

The **Fetchers Module** is a Go package designed to fetch IP ranges for various cloud providers and services. It is part of the **Caddy Defender** project, which provides middleware for blocking or manipulating traffic based on IP ranges. This module supports fetching IP ranges from AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, and more.

---

## Features

- **Multiple Cloud Providers**: Fetch IP ranges for AWS, GCP, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, and other services.
- **Region-Specific IP Ranges**: Fetch IP ranges for specific AWS regions (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).
- **Dynamic Fetching**: IP ranges are fetched dynamically from official sources (e.g., AWS, GCP).
- **Pregenerated Results**: Use pregenerated IP ranges from the `ranges/data` directory for faster setup.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new fetchers for additional services or providers.
- **Concurrency**: Fetch IP ranges concurrently for improved performance.

## Supported Fetchers

Please see [the readme](https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/caddy-defender#embedded-ip-ranges)

---

## Pregenerated Results

For convenience, pregenerated IP ranges are available in the `ranges/data` directory. These ranges are generated by running the fetchers and can be used directly in your project without needing to fetch them dynamically.

### Using Pregenerated Results

To use the pregenerated IP ranges, import the `data` package and access the `IPRanges` map:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender/ranges/data"
)

func main() {
	// Access pregenerated IP ranges for AWS
	awsRanges := data.IPRanges["aws"]
	fmt.Println("AWS IP ranges:", awsRanges)

	// Access pregenerated IP ranges for GCP
	gcloudRanges := data.IPRanges["gcloud"]
	fmt.Println("GCP IP ranges:", gcloudRanges)

	// Access pregenerated IP ranges for OpenAI
	openaiRanges := data.IPRanges["openai"]
	fmt.Println("OpenAI IP ranges:", openaiRanges)

	// Access pregenerated IP ranges for Mistral
	mistralRanges := data.IPRanges["mistral"]
	fmt.Println("Mistral IP ranges:", mistralRanges)
    // ...
}
```

### Available Pregenerated Ranges

The `IPRanges` map in the `data` package contains the following keys:

| Key             | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `vpn`           | Known VPN services                                       |
| `aws`           | Global IP ranges for AWS services.                       |
| `aws-us-east-1` | IP ranges for the AWS `us-east-1` region.                |
| `aws-us-west-1` | IP ranges for the AWS `us-west-1` region.                |
| `gcloud`        | IP ranges for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.      |
| `openai`        | IP ranges for OpenAI services (e.g., ChatGPT, GPTBot).   |
| `oci`           | IP ranges for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services |
| `githubcopilot` | IP ranges for GitHub Copilot services.                   |
| `private`       | IP ranges for private networks (used for testing).       |
| `mistral`       | IP ranges for Mistral services.                          |
| `vultr`         | IP ranges for Vultr Cloud services.                      |
| `cloudflare`    | IP ranges for Cloudflare services.                       |
| `digitalocean`  | IP ranges for Digital Ocean services.                    |
| `linode`        | IP ranges for Linode services.                           |
| `tor`           | IP addresses of Tor exit nodes (disabled by default).    |
| `asn`           | IP ranges for specific ASNs (disabled by default).       |

### Regenerating Pregenerated Results

To regenerate the pregenerated results, run the `main.go` file in the `ranges` directory:

```bash
cd ranges
go run main.go
```

This will fetch the latest IP ranges from all supported services and update the `generated.go` file in the `data` directory.

---

## Installation

To use the Fetchers Module in your Go project, install it using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender/ranges/fetchers
```

---

## Usage

### Fetching IP Ranges

To fetch IP ranges for a specific service, create an instance of the corresponding fetcher and call the `FetchIPRanges` method:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender/ranges/fetchers"
)

func main() {
	// Fetch global AWS IP ranges
	awsFetcher := fetchers.AWSFetcher{}
	ranges, err := awsFetcher.FetchIPRanges()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error fetching AWS IP ranges:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("AWS IP ranges:", ranges)
	}

	// Fetch GCP IP ranges
	gcloudFetcher := fetchers.GCloudFetcher{}
	ranges, err = gcloudFetcher.FetchIPRanges()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error fetching GCP IP ranges:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("GCP IP ranges:", ranges)
	}
}
```

### Using in Caddy Defender

The Fetchers Module is integrated into the **Caddy Defender** middleware. To use it, configure your `Caddyfile` with the `defender` directive:

```caddyfile
localhost:8080 {
    defender block {
        ranges aws gcloud openai mistral
    }
    respond "Hello, world!"
}
```

This configuration blocks requests from IP ranges associated with AWS, GCP, OpenAI, and Mistral.

## Adding New Fetchers

To add a new fetcher for a service or provider:

1. **Create a New Fetcher**:
   - Create a new file in the `fetchers` directory (e.g., `my_service.go`).
   - Implement the `IPRangeFetcher` interface:

     ```go
     package fetchers

     import (
         "fmt"
     )

     // MyServiceFetcher implements the IPRangeFetcher interface for MyService.
     type MyServiceFetcher struct{}

     func (f MyServiceFetcher) Name() string {
         return "MyService"
     }

     func (f MyServiceFetcher) Description() string {
         return "Fetches IP ranges for MyService."
     }

     func (f MyServiceFetcher) FetchIPRanges() ([]string, error) {
         // Fetch IP ranges for MyService
         return []string{"203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"}, nil
     }
     ```

2. **Add the Fetcher to `main.go`**:
   - Update the `fetchersList` in `main.go` to include your new fetcher:

     ```go
     fetchersList := []fetchers.IPRangeFetcher{
         fetchers.AWSFetcher{},
         fetchers.GCloudFetcher{},
         fetchers.MyServiceFetcher{}, // Add your new fetcher here
     }
     ```

3. **Rebuild and Test**:
   - Rebuild the project and test the new fetcher to ensure it works as expected.

Fetches global IP ranges for AWS services:

```go
awsFetcher := fetchers.AWSFetcher{}
ranges, err := awsFetcher.FetchIPRanges()
```

### AWS Region Fetcher

Fetches IP ranges for a specific AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`):

```go
awsRegionFetcher := fetchers.AWSRegionFetcher{Region: "us-east-1"}
ranges, err := awsRegionFetcher.FetchIPRanges()
```

### GCloud Fetcher

Fetches IP ranges for Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

```go
gcloudFetcher := fetchers.GCloudFetcher{}
ranges, err := gcloudFetcher.FetchIPRanges()
```
